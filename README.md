Mastercoin Tools Installation Package
=====================================

*DEPRECATED*

For up-to-date Vagrant install scripts for Master Core, Omniwallet, and OmniEngine, see the new [omni-devops](https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/omni-devops) repository.


Vagrant support for Mastercoin Development Environments
-------------------------------------------------------

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) is a provisioning tool for creating virtual development environments. For a quick introduction to Vagrant and its potential benefits read [Why Vagrant?](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/index.html)

The initial Vagrant file contains multiple VMs

* base - used to make a base box for the other VMs (advanced users only)
* empty - empty VM for quick tests of install from 'base'
* tools - Mastercoin Tools
* omni - Omniwallet (still under development)
* mastercore - A mastercore VM (built from 0.0.8 branch + Upstart init script support)

uses the ```install-msc.sh``` script to install Mastercoin Tools.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Virtual Box 4.3.10 or later
* Vagrant 1.6.2 or later

Vagrant is available for Mac OS X, Windows, and  Linux. In addition to VirtualBox, Vagrant may be used to provision VMWare, AWS and other virtual environments.

Base Box
--------

The [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) is currently using (*trusting*) the [ubuntu/trusty64](https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/trusty64) base box created by Ubuntu and the Mastercoin base box [msgilligan/mastercoin-ubuntu-base](https://vagrantcloud.com/msgilligan/mastercoin-ubuntu-base).

You should consider them untrusted binaries. Only use them with TEST-MSC and small amounts of Bitcoin.

Installing Mastercoin Tools
---------------------------

The ```tools``` VM is configured to install Mastercoin Tools.

1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html)
1. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
1. Clone this repository and check out the 'vagrant' branch

        git clone git@github.com:mastercoin-MSC/install-msc.git
        cd install-msc
        git checkout vagrant

1. Run Vagrant

        vagrant up tools

1. Connect to VirtualBox VM

        vagrant ssh tools

1. Go to the correct directory

        cd ~/mastercoin-tools/

1. Follow the instructions in the [Running](http://mastercoin-tools-installer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pages/running.html) section of the install-msc documentation.

Installing Mastercore
---------------------

The ```mastercore``` VM is configured to install Mastercore.

1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html)
1. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
1. Clone this repository and check out the 'vagrant' branch

        git clone git@github.com:mastercoin-MSC/install-msc.git
        cd install-msc
        git checkout vagrant

1. Run Vagrant

        vagrant up  mastercore

1. Connect to VirtualBox VM

        vagrant ssh  mastercore

1. Go to the mastercore build directory

        cd mastercore

1. Run the unit tests

        ./src/test/test_bitcoin
The unit tests will generate about a dozen screens of output and, if successful, the last line should read:

        *** No errors detected

1. Congratulations you have built and tested Mastercore!


AWS Installation
----------------

We now have experimental AWS support for all VMs in the Vagrantfile (Omniwallet not finished yet). Before using the Vagrant AWS provider you'll need to install it:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws

We use a "dummy" AWS base box [as recommended](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws#quick-start) by mitchellh in the `vagrant-aws` README. This is a small text file that simply specifies that the base box is an AWS image, but leaves the specification of the actual base AMI image to the `Vagrantfile` itself. Use the following command to install the "dummy" box:

    vagrant box add mitchellh-dummy-aws https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box

You'll also need to configure your private AWS information by creating a *private* shell script:

    cp setup-aws-template.sh ../setup-aws-private.sh
    chmod 700 setup-aws-private.sh

Edit `../setup-aws-private.sh` and enter your AWS information.

VM Installation is the same as for the Virtual Box provider, but with the `vagrant up` command changed to:

    source ../setup-aws-private.sh
    vagrant up tools --provider=aws
    source unset-aws-private.sh

and the `vagrant ssh` command changed to:

    source ../setup-aws-private.sh
    vagrant ssh tools
    source unset-aws-private.sh

Don't forget to source the `unset-aws-private.sh` to remove your private information from environment variables.

These instructions show the `setup-aws-private.sh` script being kept in the *parent* directory of this project. Because Vagrant by default copies the contents of the directory containing the Vagrantfile to the /vagrant directory of your EC2 instance it is not a recommended to place this file in the Vagrantfile diretory or any subdirectory.


To Do
-----

1. Better documentation

    Coming soon

1. Track versions of all components used and update to released/stable versions asap.

    [versions.adoc](versions.adoc) as a starting point

1. Create a verified/trusted Mastercoin "base box"

    We have a mastercoin base box now, but it's not verified/trusted yet.

1. Vagrant file support for Omniwallet
1. Add [Shared folders and port-forwarding](http://pastie.org/9083315)



Versions, tags, and hashes
--------------------------

I would like to see a 100% reproducible build/install. In order to do this all critical components should be versioned or tagged. I'm tracking versions of components in an AsciiDoc table named [versions.adoc](versions.adoc).
